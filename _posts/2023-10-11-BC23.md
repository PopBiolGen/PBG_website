Members of the Population Biology and Genomics Group attended the Biodiversity Conference 2023: Listen to Country, where they presented on the impending cane toad invasion of the WA Pilbara Region.

Ben's talk - 'A plan to keep toads out of the Pilbara' outlined the potential of a 'toad containment zone' to halt the spread of cane toads into the Pilbara region.
