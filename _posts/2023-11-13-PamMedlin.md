Ben was featured in a short video from ABC News Perth on the “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to prevent cane toads from spreading in parts of Western Australia’s north. It is predicted that the invasive species could advance at record speeds within a matter of years, risking destruction to native life.

In the video, reporter Pamela Medlen presents the case for a 'toad containment zone' - a concept being promoted by Ben - which could prevent the toads from invading the Pilbara region of WA.
