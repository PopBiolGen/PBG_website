Ben was recently invited to deliver the plenary talk at the annual Curtin University School of Molecular and Life Sciences research symposium.
Ben's presentation 'how to stop a billion invading toads' outlined the threats cane toads pose to the Pilbara region of Western Australia, and potential methods for stopping the invasion.

The symposium showcased the work of staff and students from within the School, which comprises the Disciplines of Ecology, Agriculture & Food, and Chemistry.
