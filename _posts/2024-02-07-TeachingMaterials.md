Ben has created two short videos on cane toads that are aimed at Year 9 science students.

In the first video, 'Cane toad introduction' Ben introduces himself and provides a brief background on toads in Australia. In the second video 'How to stop a billion invading toads' Ben steps through some of the evidence-based strategies to how the toad invasion may be stopped.
