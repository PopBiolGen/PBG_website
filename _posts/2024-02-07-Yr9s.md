Ben recently provided teaching materials for a year 9 science class, in the form of two pre-recorded presentations.  The idea is for the students to hear from a working research scientist about what they do and why they do it.  The presentations then look at a major project that PBG is working on: preventing the arrival of cane toads into the Pilbara region.

Video 1: 'Cane toads conquer northern Australia' can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/910688756).
Video 2: 'How to stop a billion invading toads' can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/910692430).
