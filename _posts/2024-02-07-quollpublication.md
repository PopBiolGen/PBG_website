Brenton has led a new research paper on managing populations of the endangered norther quoll _(Dasyurus hallucatus)_. The paper, _'Conservation prioritisation of genomic diversity to inform management of a declining mammal species'_, was published in _Biological Conservation_.

In a nutshell: Declining populations of northern quolls will lose genetic diversity through time. If we strategically conserve at least eight populations across Australia, we can prevent the loss of > 90 % of that diversity.
