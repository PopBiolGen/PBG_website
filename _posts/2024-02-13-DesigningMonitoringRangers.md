Ben met with Nyangumarta and Karajarri rangers to design sand plot surveys to enable monitoring of toad-affected species. The work was conducted on Nyangumarta country and resulted in an efficient protocol that will monitor a suite of species including sand goannas, bilbies, and ridge-tailed monitors.  These data will enable Karajarri and Nyangumarta to understand the impact of toads on the population size of these species, and will also feed into larger efforts to monitor the effectiveness of the proposed Toad Containment Zone â€“ a plan to halt the invasion of cane toads just south of Broome.
