Ben attended a research prioritisation workshop organised by Kings Park Science and the Harry Butler Institue at Murdoch university.  It was a meeting of concerned scientists and managers and was an excellent chance for people to meet and discuss what is and is not known about Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer (PSHB).

Ben presented some early results from a population dynamics model he has been working on, that will allow us to predict the potential growth rate of PSHB across WA, and will be extended to allow us to learn about critical missing pieces such as dispersal and survival rates during dispersal.
