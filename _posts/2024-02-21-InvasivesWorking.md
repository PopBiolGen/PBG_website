Brenton recently attended the first Invasive Species Working Group for the Integrated Pest Management Omics initiative. Brenton met with a variety of experts from Entozyme, CSIRO, University of the Sunshine Coast, DPIRD WA, DPI NSW, and BioPlatforms Australia to discuss and prioritise the list of invasive invertebrate species across Australia that would benefit from research and production of DNA sequencing data.
The initiative is led by Bioplatforms Australia, a non-profit organisation that supports Australian Life science research by investing in state-of-the-art infrastructure and expertise in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics. Investment funding for Bioplatforms Australia is provided by the Commonwealth Government National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy.
The initiative is one of many national collaborative projects that generate high-impact data and knowledge resources to support some of Australiaâ€™s biggest scientific challenges [https://data.bioplatforms.com/about](https://data.bioplatforms.com/about). These challenges span agriculture, biomedicine, the environment and industry, as well as extending to relevant international endeavours.
