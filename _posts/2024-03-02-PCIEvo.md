Ben recently authored a commentary piece _'The evolution of a hobo snail'_ for PCI Evolutionary Biology.  PCI is a new publishing model that looks to avoid publicly funded scientific work being locked up behind corporate paywalls.  Ben reserves the bulk of his peer review and editorial work for PCI.  This piece is a commentary on a paper that he acted as editor for.  Having managed a thorough and transparent peer-review process, the work is considered a part of the scientific canon, and the person acting as the editor gets a chance to write a commentary.  

You can read the paper _'Rapid life-history evolution reinforces competitive asymmetry between invasive and resident species'_ [here](https://peercommunityjournal.org/articles/10.24072/pcjournal.394/) and Ben's commentary _'The evolution of a hobo snail'_ [here](https://evolbiol.peercommunityin.org/articles/rec?id=713).
