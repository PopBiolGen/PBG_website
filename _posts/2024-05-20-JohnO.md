We have launched the Curtin University School of Molecular & Life Sciences Coding Club! Presented by PBG, Coding Club will run fortnightly during the teaching semester.

It was great to see so many people in attendance at our first meet-up, with representatives from across the School (ecology, agriculture, palaeontology, bioinformatics, soil science, plant pathology, forensic chemistry...) as well as some from the wider Curtin University community.

Ben kicked off the session with an introduction to coding club, and a presentation on "What is a reproducible workflow, and where can I get one?".

The aim of the club is for Higher Degree by Research students (Hons, MPhil, PhD), postdocs, and research staff to help each other with coding and coding-related problems. At club meet-ups, participants will be teaching and learning coding skills, and in the process building connections with their colleagues and peers from across the School.

We hope to build a group that supports research students and staff with coding, and that builds skills across the School.
