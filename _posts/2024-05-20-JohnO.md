We welcome Dr John Ohiolei to our team! 

John has a background in parasitology and has experience working on tapeworm epidemiology, genetic diversity and population structure in Asia and Africa. More recently, he developed interest in the application of ecological and computational/statistical approaches in understanding disease spread. 

John’s PhD project seeks to understand the invasion of the mosquito _Anopheles stephensi_ – a primary vector of malaria - in Africa, especially where it will spread to next and/or may already have been established. He also aims to explore novel and existing control strategies in managing the vector.
John spends his time split between the [Telethon Kids Institute](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/our-research/), where his primary supervisor Professor Nick Golding is based, and in the PBG offices at Curtin University in Bentley.
