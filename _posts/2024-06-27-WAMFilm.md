As part of National Science Week, the WA Museum worked with Brenton to create a video on his research. In the video, titled _‘Northern Quolls: Genetics to the Rescue with Dr Brenton von Takach’_, Brenton introduces himself and his passion for working on the conservation of Australian wildlife, and provides an overview of his research on Northern Quolls.

The video was accessed by over 45 schools during National Science Week, including schools from both rural and metro WA, the WA School of Isolated and Distance Education, interstate and international schools.
