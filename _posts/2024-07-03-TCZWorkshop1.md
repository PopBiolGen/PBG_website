Working with the fantastic team at Rangelands NRM, we delivered the first of two major workshops around the cane toad containment zone (TCZ). The workshop was hosted by Helen and David from Anna Plains Station, with brilliant catering provided by the Nyangumarta Ranger team.  The event created an important opportunity for pastoral landholders, Indigenous landowners, and the broader project team to come together to discuss the idea.  

The workshop went very well, with good engagement from all parties and a general sense that people are willing (if supported) to contribute to the success of the TCZ.
