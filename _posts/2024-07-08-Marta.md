We are pleased to welcome Marta Karolak to our team! 

Marta has joined the PBG team as a PhD candidate - her PhD is focussed on using genetic data to determine how landscape features shape the dispersal of invasive invertebrates in the Perth region. Marta will use resistance surface modelling to investigate patterns of connectivity and dispersal and aims to create a method to better monitor the spread of invasive invertebrates and prevent their further expansion in Australia. Marta has a background in terrestrial ecology, and a keen interest in research focussed on invertebrates.
