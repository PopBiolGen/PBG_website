Brenton recently attended the 10th World Congress of Herpetology, which was held in Kuching, Malaysia. Brenton presented the background and analytical pipeline for research he is undertaking in his role as WA Premier’s EMC Fellow. The talk was titled _‘Urban landscape genomics and connectivity in south-western Australia’_ and was given to a full room of global herpetology experts. Feedback was well received and there was interest in the project from several potential collaborators around the world. Brenton's recently graduated Masters student, Serin Subaraj, was also in attendance, and presented a poster on his work.

Brenton managed to squeeze in some wildlife spotting, including a nocturnal visit to the spectacularly biodiverse Kubah National Park, where he encountered over 20 species of frog and reptile.
