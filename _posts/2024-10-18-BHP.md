[BHP Social Investments](https://www.bhp.com) has provided a $400,000 grant for us to develop and test toad proof infrastructure for the [Toad Containment Zone (TCZ)](/projects/2024-04-24-TCZ/).  The funding will allow us to develop and test the toad-proof infrastructure -- such as toad-proof cattle troughs, and toad proof fences -- that will underpin the TCZ.  The funding has come at an important moment: toads are only 3-4 years away from the head of the TCZ, and while we know we can make toad-proof infrastructure, getting the details right will ensure we roll out infrastructure that is both efficient and effective.

The project is a critical plank in our efforts to build the TCZ; a project that will deliver environmental and social benefits to 27 million hectares of WA, including the entire Pilbara region.

We thank BHP for their initiative and their timely support.  We look forward to delivering this important research work.
