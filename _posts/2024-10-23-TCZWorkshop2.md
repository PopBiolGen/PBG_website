Working with the fantastic team at Rangelands NRM, we delivered the second of our major workshops around the cane toad containment zone (TCZ). The workshop was hosted at Notre Dame University in Broome, and had over 60 attendees.  The event was an opportunity for on-ground and broader stakeholders to meet, get updated, and brainstorm pathways to building the Toad Containment Zone.  The event was attended by all the on-ground stakeholders represented at workshop 1, but also by broader stakeholders from government, industry, and NGOs.  

The workshop was a great success.  On ground stakeholders signed an MoU setting out their understanding and expectations for governance and communication. Broader stakeholders looked at legal and financial models to support the TCZ, and considered the broader communications and outreach that will contribute to the TCZ's success.

The workshop was followed by a tour of the proposed TCZ for industry partners. This was a chance for further conversation, and for industry partners to see the area and the infrastructure requiring upgrade.
