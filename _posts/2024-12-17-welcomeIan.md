We are delighted to welcome Ian to the PBG team. Ian joins us from (most recently) Singapore where he has been working as a bioinformatician.  Ian is taking on the challenge of using genomics to estimate dispersal in invasive species.  He looks to integrate landscape-level approaches with kernel-based approaches to develop predictions about distances that invasive species are likely to move through real landscapes.

We are looking forward to working with him!
