We are delighted to welcome Normandie to the PBG team. Normandie joins us from Puerto Rico, where she has been working on projects ranging from orchids to toads, and building some solid expertise in analysis along the way.  She joins us to undertake a PhD looking at the cost and feasibility of eradication, and how statistical ecology can help in managing early outbreaks of pest species.  

After a few trials and tribulations (involving, among other things, a broken ankle), Normandie finally arrived in Australia.  Just in time for everyone to head off on summer break.  We are looking forward to working with her!
