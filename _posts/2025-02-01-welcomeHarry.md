We are delighted to welcome Harry Richardson-Cooke to the PBG team. Harry has joined our team as an Honours student under the supervision of Prof. Ben Phillips and Dr Judy Dunlop. Harry will be undertaking an honours project looking at different methods of cane toad detection in Northern Australia, with the hopes of developing a standardised method of monitoring cane toads.
Harry is a recent graduate of Curtin’s Bachelor of Science: Environmental Science.
Welcome Harry! We look forward to working with you!
