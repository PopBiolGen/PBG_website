PBG hosted a three-day workshop on Bayesian inference in R, in early February. Quantitative ecologist, Dr Matthijs Hollanders, presented the workshop, which focussed on mark-recapture modelling and estimating vital rates. 
We welcomed attendees from Curtin, Murdoch, UWA, DBCA, CSIRO and industry, and all departed after day three having picked up some knew knowledge and skills, and with new connections.
