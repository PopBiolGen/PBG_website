Five years in the making, Ben’s book ‘The Ecology and Evolution of Invasive Populations’ has now been published through Oxford University Press!
Book Abstract: Why do populations spread through space, and how do they change as they do so? In answering these questions, this book shows that phenomena as diverse as tumour growth and the spread of invasive species are all manifestations of the same process. As such, there are ecological and evolutionary principles in common across all these systems. This book develops both the history of, and recent advances in, our understanding of invasive populations, using a combination of empirical examples and accessible theory. It shows that populations evolve as they spread, in both predictable and unpredictable ways. The book finishes with new ideas for the management of invasive populations.
