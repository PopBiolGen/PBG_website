We are excited to have recently welcomed Carine Siew to the PBG team. Carine has joined our team as an Honours student, under the supervision of Prof. Ben Phillips and Dr Judy Dunlop. The focus of her project is on fencing and trapping methods for cane toads. Specifically, what are some of the alternate fence materials and designs that are cost effective, can last longer and required the least amount of maintenance. She is also investigating the type of traps that are most effective in trapping cane toads.
Carine is a recent graduate of Curtinâ€™s Bachelor of Science: Environmental Science (minoring in Environmental Management and Geospatial Technology). She has always been curious how animals interact with the environment and through her studies, recently discovered an interest in research. 
Welcome, Carine! We look forward to working with you!
