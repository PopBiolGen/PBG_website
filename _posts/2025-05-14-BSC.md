PBG hosted a two-day workshop on [Biosecurity Commons](https://www.biosecuritycommons.org.au/) in mid May. Biosecurity Commons is a cloud-based platform designed to make complex modelling accessible through simple workflows. 
Our workshop presenters Dr Rob Clemens from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and Rupert Marquand from the Centre of Excellence for Biosecurity Risk Analysis (CEBRA)/The University of Melbourne provided participants with training in how to undertake risk mapping and surveillance design using the Biosecurity Commons platform.

We welcomed 22 attendees to the workshop, with participants from Curtin, Murdoch, and the WA Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD).
