Ben and his collaborators have been awarded funding from the WA Agricultural Research Collaboration (WAARC) as part of their new $2.17 million Polyphagous Shot-hole Borer Research Program to help address this critical biosecurity issue.
Ben’s project, ‘Decision support tools for managing polyphagous shot-hole borer’ will develop predictive models and risk maps to help prioritise surveillance and control efforts, ensuring efficient resource allocation and enhanced decision-making. The project will be a collaboration with DPIRD, Murdoch and UWA. The methodologies and tools that will be developed as part of this project will be adaptable to other biosecurity challenges faced by Australia.
