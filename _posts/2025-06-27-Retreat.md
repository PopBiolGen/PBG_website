In late June, the Population Biology and Genomics team (Ben, Brenton, Haylee, Judy, Holly, John, Marta, Ian, Normandie, Carine, and Josh) embarked on our 2025 Writing Retreat. The Writing Retreat was a great opportunity for the team to spend some time together and to focus on our writing goals.
We spent five days/four nights together in the lovely town of Walpole, a 5-hour drive south of Perth. We spent most of our days warm inside writing – either alone or in group ‘pomodoro’ writing sessions.
We also took the opportunity to have some fun – we took an eco-cruise with WOW Wilderness, explored the Valley of the Giants, visited the Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree, went bird watching, and played some games.
