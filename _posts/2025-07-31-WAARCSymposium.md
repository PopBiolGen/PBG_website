The WA Agricultural Research Collaboration recently brought together leading scientists, policy makers and other stakeholders for a symposium focussed on limiting the spread of PSHB. The symposium was a chance to learn more about the three new collaborative research projects, supported through $2.17 million in funding from WAARC. 
Ben is lead of one of the [three projects](https://waarc.org.au/opportunities/polyphagous-shot-hole-borer-fusarium-dieback/), and [presented on the project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ND-2LD-aY&list=PL24LGwlcuhHBXMWFAACkWQYTLkj78q_ns&index=10) which is developing predictive models and risk maps to support smarter surveillance and control of one of WA’s (and Australia’s) most significant biosecurity threats. 
Ben also contributed to the [panel discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lddZnoG0akw&list=PL24LGwlcuhHBXMWFAACkWQYTLkj78q_ns&index=10), alongside Prof. Treena Burgess (Murdoch), Assoc. Prof. Theo Evans (UWA), and Vincent Lanoiselet (DPIRD).
