The WA Agricultural Research Collaboration recently brought together leading scientists, policy makers and other stakeholders for a symposium focussed on limiting the spread of PSHB. The symposium was a chance to learn more about the three new collaborative research projects, supported through $2.17 million in funding from WAARC. 
Ben is lead of one of the [three projects](https://waarc.org.au/opportunities/polyphagous-shot-hole-borer-fusarium-dieback/), and presented on the project which is developing predictive models and risk maps to support smarter surveillance and control of one of WA’s (and Australia’s) most significant biosecurity threats. 
Ben also contributed to the panel discussion, alongside Prof. Treena Burgess (Murdoch), Assoc. Prof. Theo Evans (UWA), and Vincent Lanoiselet (DPIRD).
