Ben and Professor Treena Burgess (forest pathologist and executive director at the Harry Butler Institute, Murdoch University) sat down with RTRFM presenter Monica Main, host of the This Changes Everything podcast.
It was a long form interview about the impacts of the beetle in Perth, the fight to eradicate the shot-hole borer, the opportunity it presents to restore native landscapes, and how we might mitigate their ongoing spread and impact.
