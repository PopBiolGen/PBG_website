PBG HDR student Normandie Gonzalez Orellana has been awarded a scholarship by the WA Agricultural Research Collaboration (WAARC). Normandie is one of the high-calibre HDR students to be awarded one of the WAARC scholarships in the 2025 round. 
Normandie is developing models for early eradication and management of invasive species, with the Polyphagous shot-hole borer (PSHB) WA invasion as a study system. She is working to determine the factors influencing the rapid spread of PSHB in WA and developing models to help advance biosecurity strategies.
Congratulations Normandie!
