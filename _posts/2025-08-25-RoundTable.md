In late August, Ben was invited to take part in the Invasive Fauna Roundtable at Parliament House. The roundtable brought together dozens of leading researchers, philanthropists, technologists, advocates and government officials for discussion around how innovation in invasive species management in Australia can be accelerated.
One of the aims of the Roundtable was to determine what the most impactful initiative might be that philanthropists and government could collaborate on to make the biggest impact in eradicating invasive fauna in Australia.
Thank you to Senator David Pocock and the Skip Foundation for hosting the roundtable and driving this initiative.
