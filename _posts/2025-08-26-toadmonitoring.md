Ben and Tim Dempster from Deakin University spent a week with Indigenous rangers from three groups (Nyikina Mangala, Karajarri, and Nyangumarta) getting lost in the desert and pinning down the current location of the cane toad invasion front.  The week was both valuable science, but also a valuable exchange of toad and country know how.
