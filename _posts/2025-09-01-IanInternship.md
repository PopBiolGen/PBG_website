PBG PhD candidate Ian Lim has commenced a Curtin University Intern Fellowship (1 Sept 2025 – 1 Mar 2026), titled 'Understanding feral cat dispersal in Dryandra National Park and surrounds: insights from genomic and movement datasets’. The intern fellowship is co-funded by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) with $5,000 in project funds, to support data collaboration and statistical analyses of genomic and camera-trap datasets of feral cats in Dryandra National Park. 
Ian’s internship is supervised by Dr Kym Ottewell, with data sharing collaboration with Mark Cowan and the Peel Harvey Catchment Council. The project integrates population genomics, kinship analysis, and camera-trap movement data to develop a multi-faceted understanding of cat dispersal. Results will contribute to a scientific publication led by the PhD candidate. Ian presented preliminary findings on cat natal dispersal at the Biodiversity Conference 2025 on October 30, 2025.
