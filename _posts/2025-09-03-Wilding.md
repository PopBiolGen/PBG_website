Bush Heritage Australia recently hosted a sold-out screening of the documentary ‘Wilding’ at Luna Cinemas Leederville, which was followed by a panel discussion with local experts – one of which was PBG’s Dr Holly Kirk. 
The documentary, based on a book of the same name by Isabella Tree, follows the journey of a failing farm in southern England as the owners stop farming, and allow ‘rewilding’ to occur. In this context, ‘rewilding’ was about allowing nature to restore "without trying to control what it looks like".
Following the screening of the documentary, Dr Bruce Webber, Bush Heritage Australia Science and Conservation Manager, hosted a panel discussion. The panel members Holly Kirk, Steve McCabe and Jane Chambers shared their insights with the audience, providing some local context to the documentary.
