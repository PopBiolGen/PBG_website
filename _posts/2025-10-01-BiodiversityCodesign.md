Ben, Judy, Grace, and Professor Sarah Legge (ANU) met with Karajarri and Nyangumarta rangers in Bidyadanga to decide on priority species and methods for monitoring biodiversity before and after the arrival of toads.  The workshop was a brilliant success.  Enthusiastic engagement from both ranger teams resulted in a species list quite different from what the scientists would have chosen, and the inclusion of goanna hunting and track monitoring as monitoring methods.  We left with the task of finalising the monitoring plan for roll out in mid 2026.
