Congratulations to PBG’s Honours students, Josh Lemmon and Carine Siew who have submitted their Honours theses and delivered their final presentations.
Josh investigated variation in colour and texture patterns among species of froglets (Crinia spp.) in south-western Australia, quantifying whether specific morphs exhibit sex- or species-specific frequencies within and among populations. By integrating morphological data with species identification, his work contributes to a refined understanding of phenotypic differentiation and potential evolutionary drivers of variation within the genus.
Carine (supervised by Ben Phillips and Judy Dunlop) investigated fencing designs to exclude cane toads. Specifically, fencing materials and designs that are cost effective, long lasting and low in maintenance. Carine has recently commenced an internship with Rio Tinto in Queensland.
