As a WAARC R2 Scholarship recipient, PBG PhD candidate Normandie participated of the inaugural WAARC Showcase.
The showcase was an event dedicated to connecting researchers and industry across Western Australia’s agricultural research landscape. Around 150 people attended the event, which included presentations from industry and current WAARC students, panel discussions, and a poster session.
Normandie enjoyed the opportunity to network with fellow students, learn about the latest research in agriculture, and share her PhD research through a poster.
