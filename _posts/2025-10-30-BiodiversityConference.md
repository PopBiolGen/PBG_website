Several members of the PBG team attended and presented at the 2025 WA Biodiversity Conference, which was held at the University Club on Western Australia from the 28th- 30th October 2025. The conference was a great opportunity for the team to share their research with and to connect with the wider biodiversity science and conservation community in WA.

Talks delivered by the team were:

- Ben:  ‘Lessons for reintroducitons, from invasion biology’
- Holly: ‘Rethinking environmental impact assessment for nature positive development’
- Judy: ‘Stemming the toad: Containing cane toads with ecosystem management’.
- Normandie: ‘Burning Bridges: Early eradication and management of invasive species’.
- Ian: ‘Tracking the killer’s kin: Estimating dispersal of feral cats with close-kin genetic techniques’.
- Josh: ‘Patterns in the Pond: Investigating colour and texture variations among species of froglets (Crinia spp.) in South-Western Australia’
- Carine: ‘Fence and trap design for cane toads’.
