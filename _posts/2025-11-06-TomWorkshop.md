PBG hosted a workshop on Tracking dispersal using identity by descent in early November. The workshop was presented by Dr Tom Schmidt, ARC DECRA Fellow/ Lecturer at the University of Sydney. Tom’s work investigates how species adapt and move through changing environments.
We welcomed 12 attendees to the workshop, with participants from Curtin, Murdoch, and the WA Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA), and industry.

Tom also delivered a talk to the Curtin Environmental Analytics Network on ‘Evolution on human timescales’ while visiting Curtin.
