PBG HDR student Ian Lim has been awarded a Royal Society of Western Australia John Glover Research Support Grant. John Glover research support grants are awarded annually to support students studying the natural sciences in Western Australia. The grant of $15,000 will primarily be used to cover project costs.
Ian is channeling his passion for conservation and wildlife genomics to study invasive species in Western Australia. His research explores computational approaches to estimate natal dispersal and gene flow directionality at a fine-scale landscape. Using the invasive Portuguese millipede (Ommatoiulus moreleti) as a model species, Ian applies close-kin genetic methods and landscape resistance to uncover how small, cryptic invertebrates move between habitats to inform strategies in managing invasive spread and protect native biodiversity in Perth bushlands.
Congratulations Ian!
