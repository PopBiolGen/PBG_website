The TCZ team met with Rio Tinto, GHD, local pastoralists and representatives from Nyangumarta and Karajarri to work out finer details of the infrastructure upgrades required for the TCZ.  The two-day workshop was an excellent exchange, with everyone leaving with a sense of each other's needs, and what our shared pathway forward looks like.  Thanks to all for their thoughtful and open engagement.
