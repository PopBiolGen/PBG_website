Every fortnight, the WA Agricultural Research Collaboration (WAARC) profiles one of Western Australia’s leading scientists whose curiosity, expertise and commitment are shaping the future of agriculture.
The ‘WA Agricultural Scientist Spotlight’ series dives into the career journeys, inspirations and research driving WA’s most innovative thinkers, highlighting how their work contributes to more resilient, productive and sustainable agricultural systems.
Ben was featured in the series, as his  expertise in ecology and evolutionary biology sits at the crossroads of some of agriculture’s most pressing challenges – from invasive species to the movement of genes across landscapes.
