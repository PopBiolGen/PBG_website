Ben, Brenton, and Haylee hosted a booth at the DISCOVER ‘Innovators Expo’, where they showcased the work of the PBG team. The ~40 students in attendance were eager to learn about the work being done by the team on vertebrate ecology, turtle genetics, the PSHB invasion, and the toad containment zone.
DISCOVER is a three-day STEM program for Year 8 and 9 students that aims to give students an immersive taste of what being a university STEM student is like. 
The DISCOVER program showcased WA’s expertise in wide a range of science fields, and gave attendees the opportunity to work in real laboratories, hear from current students, and speak with Curtin scientists and engineers.
