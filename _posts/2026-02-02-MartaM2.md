PBG PhD student Marta recently achieved her PhD Milestone 2! As part of her Milestone 2 requirements, Marta delivered a presentation on the work she has undertaken to date, and planned work for the remainder of her PhD project ‘Highways or back tracks: Understanding animal dispersal and habitat connectivity using genomic data’.
The goal of Milestone 2 is for PhD candidates to reflect on the progress made in their research projects and to finalise a strategy for the timely completion and dissemination of their research findings.
Congratulations Marta!
