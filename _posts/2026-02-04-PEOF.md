Ben and Judy recently presented their work on the impact of cane toads and the toad containment zone, at an industry workshop in Perth. The workshop was hosted by the Pilbara Environmental Offsets Fund (PEOF), the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) and the Chamber of Minerals and Energy (CME) and was aimed at awareness raising and early preparation for toads in the Pilbara.
