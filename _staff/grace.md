Grace has a deep passion for community engagement and environmental research. With over 20 years of experience, she has contributed to a variety of organisations and projects in both Mauritius and Australia. Based in Broome, Grace initially focused on migratory shorebirds however recently expanded her research to include other aspects of environmental conservation, including the Toad Containment Zone (TCZ). Recognizing the importance of collaboration for the success of on-ground projects, Grace emphasizes the need for close partnerships with landowners and land managers to better understand and implement conservation efforts across northern Australia. By highlighting the crucial role landholders play in wildlife conservation, Grace advocates for a synergy between ecologists, farmers, and project managers, working together to achieve a balance that supports both food production and biodiversity conservation.
