Josh is an Honours student at Curtin University under the supervision of Dr Brenton von Takach. His research aims to investigate variation in colour and texture patterns among species of froglets (Crinia spp.) in south-western Australia, by quantifying whether specific morphs exhibit sex- or species-specific frequencies within and among populations. By integrating morphological data with species identification, his work contributes to a refined understanding of phenotypic differentiation and potential evolutionary drivers of variation within the genus.}
